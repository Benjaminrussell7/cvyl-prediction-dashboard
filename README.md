# CVYL Schedule Scraper

Python project for scraping CVYL lacrosse schedules and scores into a cleaned, canonical one-row-per-game CSV.

This project intentionally stops at data collection and cleaning. It does not build prediction models, and core logic lives in importable Python modules rather than notebooks.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Configure Sources

Copy the example config and replace the placeholder URLs with real CVYL schedule pages.

```bash
cp config/sources.example.yml config/sources.yml
```

Example:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: cvyl_boys_14u
    url: "https://example.com/schedule"
    season: 2026
    division: "14U Boys"
```

## Run

```bash
python -m cvyl_scraper.cli \
  --config config/sources.yml \
  --output data/processed/cvyl_games.csv
```

The exported CSV contains one canonical row per game with normalized team names, dates, scores, game status, and source metadata.

## How to Run the Dashboard Locally

After generating the processed CSV outputs, run:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The dashboard reads existing files from `data/processed/` and shows model summary metrics, power rankings, matchup predictions, team details, and backtest results.

## Known Limitations

- Predictions and rankings are based only on scores currently reported on CVYL.org.
- Some recent games may be missing if scores have not been posted yet.
- Team identity depends on the canonical names and any explicit aliases configured locally.
- The matchup projection uses simple ELO, scoring averages, SOS, and backtest outputs; it is not a machine learning model.

## Output Columns

```text
game_date, game_time, season, division, home_team, away_team,
home_score, away_score, status, source_name, source_url, game_id
```

`status` is either:

- `completed`: both scores are available
- `scheduled`: scores are missing

Mirrored duplicate rows are collapsed by a stable game key based on date, teams, division, season, and available score/status information.
